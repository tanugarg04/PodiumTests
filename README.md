# Steps to execute tests
1. Download Chrome version 80.x to your machine. Corresponding Chrome driver compatible with v80 is included in this repo. If you want to run a different chromedriver, please replace current driver @ src/test/resources/drivers with a new one and keep the name same as "chromedriver-80.mac".
2. Clone/download the repo.
3. In Terminal (or other shell application) navigate to repo directory. Like - PodiumTests-master (if you downloaded master branch).
4. Setup your environment with correct JAVA, MVN variables, as appropriate.
5. Run command "mvn clean install" to execute the tests.
6. See the magic :)
